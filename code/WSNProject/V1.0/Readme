Accel woring - we are capturing 10 readings and taking avg of it and then checking for threshold and then making the decision
		if counter reaches to 10 then we are monitoring the temp

if temp increases above the threshold then monitoring the mic

and if we observe any motion in between this, we are breaking out of the loop and going back to initial condition
